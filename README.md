A test of WPF and .NET capabilities by creating a small standalone To-Do List Desktop Widget for personal usage. Free for personal usage, not for commercial distribution.

I may add further functionality later on, but that is yet to be determined
List of features I may implement in the future:
- Drag and drop ordering
- Tab system so you can have multiple lists
-   Possibly also name the tabs
- Text wrapping (doesn't work quite so well at the moment)
- Figure out how to minimize to system tray (might be a Windows feature that I haven't figured out)
- Test saving feature. If I hard shut down my computer, will likely not save my to do list
